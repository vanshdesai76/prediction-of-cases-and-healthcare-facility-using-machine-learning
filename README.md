# Prediction of Cases and Healthcare Facility Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project, titled **"Prediction of Cases and Healthcare Facility Using Machine Learning"**, aims to develop a model to predict ventilator and intubation requirements for COVID-19 patients.This was first work with ML of Mexico Data.The project was carried out by **Vansh Desai (19CE018)** under the guidance of **Prof. Mayuri Popat** at the **U & P U. Patel Department of Computer Engineering, Chandubhai S. Patel Institute of Technology (CSPIT), CHARUSAT**.

## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health and economic crisis. Predicting patient outcomes is crucial for resource allocation, such as ICU beds and ventilators. This project developed models to predict ICU admissions, ventilator needs, and other critical outcomes using machine learning techniques. The model uses data from sources like Kaggle and the Mexican Government to predict outcomes and assist in effective resource distribution.

## Project Structure

### 1. Introduction
- **Project Summary**: Overview of the forecasting system for COVID-19, predicting new cases and recoveries.
- **Objective**: To identify the medical risk of a patient with COVID-19, focusing on those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU admission.
- **Scope**: Use of machine learning in medicine, leveraging datasets from Kaggle and the Mexican Government.

### 2. Project Management
- **Project Planning**: Steps involved in gathering and preprocessing data, researching appropriate models, training, testing, and evaluation.

### 3. System Requirements Study
- **Hardware Requirements**: A high-performance laptop.
- **Software Requirements**: ANACONDA Python 3.7, Google Colab, FBPROPHET Library, Matplotlib Library, IMBLERN Library.

### 4. System Analysis
- **Study of Current System**: Analysis of the dataset and its variables, correlation matrix, chi-square test for feature selection, and results from various algorithms (e.g., K Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine).

### 5. Limitations and Future Enhancements
- **Limitations**: Model accuracy, handling null values, data accuracy, and training difficulties.
- **Future Enhancements**: Improving public health surveillance, setting priorities, planning, and conducting disease control programs.

### 6. Conclusion and Discussion
- **Self-Analysis of Project Viabilities**: Statistical methods like F1 score and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Summary of Project Work**: Contribution to hospitals and policymakers in resource distribution and motivation for standardizing and sharing data.
